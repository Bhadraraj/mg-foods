# API Integration Guide for User, Role, and Labour Management

## Overview
This integration connects your React frontend with the Node.js/MongoDB backend APIs for managing Users, Roles, and Labour records.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Created Role Service (`roleService`)
- Added complete CRUD operations for roles
- Handles role permissions and status management
- Matches the backend API endpoints exactly

### 2. Updated Management Hooks
- **`useUserManagement`**: Uses actual user API calls
- **`useRoleManagement`**: Now uses API instead of local state
- **`useLabourManagement`**: Enhanced to handle API response structure

### 3. Data Transformers
- Converts API data format to match UI expectations
- Handles the `no` field generation for display
- Transforms role permissions between array and object formats
- Manages the status field (Active/Inactive vs isActive boolean)

### 4. Updated Dashboard Component
- Removed local role state management
- Added proper error handling for all operations
- All three modules now use consistent API patterns

## API Endpoints Structure

```typescript
ENDPOINTS = {
  USERS: {
    BASE: '/api/users',
    BY_ID: (id) => `/api/users/${id}`,
    TOGGLE_STATUS: (id) => `/api/users/${id}/toggle-status`,
  },
  ROLES: {
    BASE: '/api/roles',
    BY_ID: (id) => `/api/roles/${id}`,
    TOGGLE_STATUS: (id) => `/api/roles/${id}/toggle-status`,
  },
  LABOUR: {
    BASE: '/api/labour',
    BY_ID: (id) => `/api/labour/${id}`,
    TOGGLE_STATUS: (id) => `/api/labour/${id}/toggle-status`,
  }
}
```

## Data Flow

### Users
1. Frontend calls `userService.getUsers()` â†’ Backend `/api/users`
2. Backend returns `{ success: true, data: { users: [...] } }`
3. `transformUserData()` adds display properties (`no` field)
4. UI receives properly formatted user data

### Roles
1. Frontend calls `roleService.getRoles()` â†’ Backend `/api/roles`
2. Backend returns `{ success: true, data: { roles: [...] } }`
3. `transformRoleData()` converts permissions array to `screens` format
4. UI receives roles with proper display format

### Labour
1. Frontend calls `labourService.getLabour()` â†’ Backend `/api/labour`
2. Backend returns `{ success: true, data: { labourRecords: [...] } }`
3. `transformLabourData()` adds display properties
4. UI receives properly formatted labour data

## Key Features

### Error Handling
- All API calls wrapped in try-catch blocks
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states managed properly

### Data Consistency
- Backend uses `_id` for database IDs
- Frontend transforms to `no` field for display
- Status field converts between `isActive` (API) and `Active/Inactive` (UI)

### Permissions Management
- Role permissions stored as array in backend
- Transformed to object format for form handling
- Dashboard features prefixed with `dashboard.`

## Usage Examples

### Creating a User
```typescript
const userData = {
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  password: "password123",
  mobile: "1234567890",
  role: "cashier",
  store: "Main Store",
  billType: "GST"
};

await createUser(userData);
```

### Creating a Role
```typescript
const roleData = {
  roleName: "Manager",
  permissions: {
    sales: true,
    reports: true,
    users: false
  },
  dashboardFeatures: {
    analytics: true,
    inventory: false
  }
};

await createRole(roleData);
```

### Creating Labour Record
```typescript
const labourData = {
  name: "Worker Name",
  mobile: "9876543210",
  address: "Worker Address",
  monthlySalary: 15000
};

await createLabour(labourData);
```

## Backend Compatibility

The integration is designed to work with your existing backend controllers:
- `userController.js` â†’ All endpoints supported
- `labourController.js` â†’ All endpoints supported  
- `roleController.js` â†’ All endpoints supported

## Next Steps

1. **Replace your existing hooks** with the updated `useManagement` hooks
2. **Add the new services** (`roleService`) to your API layer
3. **Update your types** with the provided TypeScript definitions
4. **Test each module** to ensure proper API integration
5. **Add search functionality** by updating the API calls with query parameters

The system now provides complete API integration while maintaining the same UI/UX experience you had before.
